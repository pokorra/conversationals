Conversationals
It is exclusively Polish-language project, created to give people with low communication skills a hand.
Here you can see a database that contains sentences you can use in random, everyday communication: when you are standing in line with strangers or during a holiday with your family. "Conversationals" is your rescue - just peek at the screen and you will immediately know what to say when your beloved granny mentions subjects such as Antibiotics, Jews or Chip Cards.

This project logic is based on communication with JSON-organized database stored online. The code has been written in vanilla JS, with no frameworks. Although, I did use one JS library: a gsap. I am just starting with JS animations and let's say this was my shy attempt to smooth things up.
To code layout I did use SCSS features and then processed it with Gulp.js.

Have fun finding and using comments that will guarantee nothing less than respect of your interlocutors!
