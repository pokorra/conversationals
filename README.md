## Project description
It is exclusively Polish-language project, created to give people with low communication skills a hand.
Here you can see a database that contains sentences you can use in random, everyday communication: when you are standing in line with strangers or during a holiday with your family. "Conversationals" is your rescue - just peek at the screen and you will immediately know what to say when your beloved granny mentions subjects such as Antibiotics, Jews or Chip Cards.

## Project tech and architecture
This project logic is based on communication with JSON-organized database stored online and fetched with JS. 
For users who are looking for a particular subject I made an search-input which lets them find what they need without searching through paginated list.
The code has been written in vanilla JS, with no frameworks. Although, I did use a Gsap library to animate project intro a little bit.
To code layout I did use SCSS features and then processed it with Gulp.js.

Have fun finding and using comments that will guarantee nothing less than respect of your interlocutors!
